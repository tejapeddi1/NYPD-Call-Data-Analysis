# NYPD-Call-Data-Analysis

This is a Big Data Analysis Project focuses on analyzing the 911 emergency call data provided by the New York Police Department (NYPD). This project aims to gain insights into patterns, trends, and characteristics of emergency calls to aid in resource allocation, decision-making, and policy planning.
I have used Pyspark and Databricks to process this large data and used matplotlib for Data Visualization
