# NYPD-Call-Data-Analysis

This is a Big Data Analysis Project focuses on analyzing the 911 emergency call data provided by the New York Police Department (NYPD). This project aims to gain insights into patterns, trends, and characteristics of emergency calls to aid in resource allocation, decision-making, and policy planning.
I have used Pyspark and Databricks to process this large data.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises records of 911 emergency calls received by the NYPD. It includes information such as the date and time of the call, the type of incident reported, the location of the incident, and other relevant details. The dataset is sourced from NYC Open Data
